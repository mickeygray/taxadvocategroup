            We offer a range of services to help you navigate tax issues,

          <h2 className="tax-negotiation-subtitle">
            ✔ Currently Not Collectible
          </h2>
          <p>
            If you’re unable to pay your tax debt due to financial hardship, the
            IRS may grant you
            <a href="/tax-negotiation/currently-not-collectible">
              {" "}
              Currently Not Collectible
            </a>{" "}
            status. This means the IRS temporarily pauses collection efforts,
            giving you the breathing room you need. Our team can help you
            determine if you qualify and guide you through the process of
            securing this relief.
          </p>

          {/* IRS Installment Plans */}
          <h2 className="tax-negotiation-subtitle">✔ IRS Installment Plans</h2>
          <p>
            When paying your tax debt in full isn’t possible, an
            <a href="/tax-negotiation/irs-installment-plans">
              {" "}
              IRS installment plan
            </a>{" "}
            may be the right solution. These plans allow you to break your debt
            into manageable monthly payments. We’ll work with you to negotiate
            terms that fit your budget while keeping you compliant with IRS
            requirements.
          </p>

          {/* Penalty Abatement */}
          <h2 className="tax-negotiation-subtitle">✔ Penalty Abatement</h2>
          <p>
            IRS penalties can significantly increase your tax debt, but you may
            be eligible for
            <a href="/tax-negotiation/penalty-abatement">
              {" "}
              penalty abatement
            </a>{" "}
            under certain circumstances. Whether due to reasonable cause, a
            first-time offense, or other qualifying factors, we’ll help you
            petition the IRS to reduce or eliminate penalties, saving you money
            and reducing stress.
          </p>

            </a>{" "}
            allows you to settle your tax debt for less than the full amount
            owed. This is an excellent option for those who cannot pay their
            full tax liability and meet specific IRS criteria. Our experts will
            evaluate your eligibility, prepare your application, and negotiate
            with the IRS on your behalf to secure the best possible outcome.
